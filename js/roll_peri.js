        "Militant Rebels (+2 Military)<br></b><i>The losers of a civil war, the allies and accomplicaces of a failed coup, or an exiled army unit found this settlement. Regardless of the current state, this place never lost its martial heritage.</i><b><br>",

        "Spiritual Community (+2 Social)<br></b><i>The founders of this community were leaders of a religious or philosophical movement. Perhaps a major religious or education institution is still present here. Regardless, customs, laws, and traditions reflect this religious/spiritual/intellectual past providing a sense of unity.</i><b><br>",

    {"title": "The obstacle the city faces is", "id":"SandboxCityObstacle", "roll":
    [ 
        "Seedy Reputation (Social/Corruption)<br></b><i>The place is a byword for rapacious officials, thieving merchants, vicious peasants, grasping magistrates, and all the worst habits imaginable by their neighbors. No one dares to have any more trade with them than they absolutely must, and the natives of the place are considered one cut better than outright bandits. In some cases, this reputation is entirely deserved, and the locals really are as pure a lot of unmitigated bastards as they are said to be. In other cases the spite is a relic of some ancient quarrel or dusty hate that lives on in mutterings and contempt.</i><b>",
        "Class Issues (Social/Despair)<br></b><i>The poor hate the rich, the rich hate the poor, the farmers hate the herdsmen and the herdsmen hate the farmers. The location is riven with vicious quarrels and mutual despite, as at least two major classes of inhabitants absolutely detest each other. In some cases the merit of one side or another might be relatively clear, but the sheer loathing guarantees that any conventional justice will rapidly degenerate into savage score-settling and brutal reprisal. Most such places exist in a tenuous and bloody balance until one side gets the upper hand and an orgy of violence settles matters for good.</i><b>",
        "Contaminated lands (Wealth/Poverty)<br></b><i>The earth is poisoned, either by bitter salts from poor irrigation techniques, a toxin naturally present in the local soil, or the vile influence of supernatural forces. Crops are ragged and sparse, and some lands leave their inhabitants sick with persistent coughs, weeping boils, reddened eyes, or disturbing sorcerous mutations. The locals would have moved away by now, but the fouled earth tends to encourage bandits and robber-princes to stay well away.</i><b>",
        "Corrupt Leadership (Social/Corruption)<br></b><i>The local leadership is utterly corrupt. All thoughts of duty and selfless obligation have been abandoned in favor of sheer avarice and the pleasures of rule. Nothing can be accomplished without the favor of one of the local leaders, and that approval can only be acquired through bribes and shameful favors. The leaders would rather be unquestioned masters of a poor place than dutiful servants of a wealthy one.</i><b>",
        "Crushed Spirits (Social/Despair)<br></b><i>The locals exist in a state of abject degradation. They have suffered poverty, tyranny, or misfortune so long that they can no longer imagine any better existence. Their lives are brutal with privation and many of the kinder and more selfless impulses of humanity have been stamped out by the harshness of their circumstances. They dream of nothing better and hope for nothing more elevated than another day of existence. Even those opportunities that do lie before them often go untried out of simple hopelessness.</i><b>",
        "Demagogue (Social/Despair)<br></b><i>The locals are in the thrall of a zealous demagogue. He or she is preaching some vicious or foolish creed, one that leaves the locals hostile to outsiders or spending all their spare effort towards aggrandizing some strange cause. Productive labors are abandoned in favor of rallies, festivals, and the occasional pogrom against unbelievers.</i><b>",
        "Destructive Customs (Wealth/Ignorance)<br></b><i>For uncounted generations the locals have stubbornly adhered to customs and traditions that are ruinous to long-term prosperity. Their surplus goods might be sacrificed yearly to some ancestral deity, or women might be crippled in childhood to demonstrate the wealth of a family that can afford to lose their labor, or a large portion of the population might be ritually forbidden from performing useful work. At some point in the past these customs might have been based on some real need, but now they only serve to keep the people poor and weak.</i><b>",
        "Disunity (Social/Despair)<br></b><i>The community has turned against itself, with families and factions atomized into hostile, suspicious camps. Both great fortune and great misery can lead to such squabbling, either in the division of a windfall to the community or the remorseless need to claim scarce resources for survival. The various groups cannot trust each other enough to pool their efforts toward something better, and old grudges and slights are preserved as reasons to keep tomorrow as suspicious as today.</i><b>",
        "Exceptional Poverty (Wealth/Poverty)<br></b><i>Most settlements manage to give the necessities of decent life to those with hands for hard work and a few strokes of luck. Settlements laboring under exceptional poverty are not so fortunate. Either because of the cruel exactions of outside lords, the depredations of local rulers, or the miserable infertility of the local soil, the natives are hard-pressed even to find enough to eat.</i><b>",
        "Mercenary Populace (Social/Corruption)<br></b><i>The locals are an honorless and mercenary lot, careless of their promises and interested only in immediate gain. Agreements struck with them are kept precisely so long as they remain profitable, and not a moment longer. The natives might be more trustworthy toward their own kind, but outsiders are viewed as sheep to be sheared. A good offer from a rival will see them turn their coat in a blink.</i><b>",
        "Plagued by Monsters (Military/Disorder)<br></b><i>Brute beasts and hissing things in the night creep about the place, pouncing upon the unwary and doing cruel injury to the flocks and herds of any locals. Travelers cannot follow the trails in safety, and men and women do not open their doors after the sun goes down. These monsters are rarely intelligent, but their animal cunning and vicious hungers are unrelenting as any bandit’s cupidity.</i><b>",
        "Recurrent Sickness (Wealth/Ignorance)<br></b><i>There is evil air in the place, or sickly water, or a confluence of demonic influences propitious to plagues and fever. It may be that a god of disease has a shrine here, his servants diligent in their cultivation of sicknesses that never touch the faithful. Plague spirits may haunt ruins or noisome jungle glens, and their sendings might leave the natives listless with illness and weary suffering.</i><b>",
        "Riotous Protests (Military/Disorder)<br></b><i>The locals are thoroughly unruly, given to brawling, casual violence against enemies, and a careless contempt for legal process. It’s all but impossible to extract any sort of useful service or taxation from them so long as they persist in their habits of hostility and tendency to riot.</i><b>",
        "Secret Society (Social/Corruption)<br></b><i>There is a secretive band of conspirators in the place that act as its true rulers. The chieftains or officials who seem to be the local government are no more than catspaws or luckless puppets of the secret society, and the natives are hushed with fear at the thought of incurring their inescapable wrath. Before any outside power can be master here, the society must be broken or coopted to their service.</i><b>",
        "Ravaged Infrastructure (Wealth/Poverty)<br></b><i>Something terrible happened to the place in the past and a lot of the community's assets and industry were destroyed. The damage was caused either by a passing storm, natural disaster or war. Many areas of this place will need to be rebuilt or restored for that community to be back on its feet.</i><b>",
        "Raiders (Military/Uprising)<br></b><i>Monstrous humanoids, brutes and/or Bandit Raiders run rampant over the lands. Whatever the case, this site is plagued by a persistent and relentless band of raiders, ones unwilling to be driven away by ordinary reprisals.</i><b>",
        "Natural Problems (Wealth/Poverty)<br></b><i>The land around the site is precarious. It could be poor traveling roads or conditions. It could be floods, landslides, bad water, storms, or blights. Civilization can be brought here but will require investment and innovation in order to secure trade.</i><b>"
